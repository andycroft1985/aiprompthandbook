## üåü Why This Handbook Exists

Creating high-quality AI-generated content requires more than just basic prompts. Each AI model has its own "language" and responds differently to various prompting techniques. This handbook aims to bridge the gap between generic prompting and expert-level results by providing:

- **Model-specific techniques** that leverage the unique strengths of each AI platform
- **Proven formulas and templates** for consistent, high-quality generation
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues and limitations
- **Workflow optimization** strategies for different use cases
- **Parameter reference sheets** for fine-tuning your results

#### Key Strategies for DALL-E 3

1. **Be Specific**: Unlike other models, DALL-E 3 benefits from longer, more detailed prompts.
2. **Describe What You Want**: Focus on describing the desired outcome rather than technical parameters.
3. **Reference Specific Styles**: Name artists or art movements for stylistic influence.
4. **Include Composition Details**: Mention camera angles, perspective, and framing.

## üõ† Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Distorted Faces | Prompt complexity, model limitations | ‚Ä¢ Add "detailed face, realistic features" to prompt<br>‚Ä¢ Use face-focused negative prompts<br>‚Ä¢ Try different model version |
| Inconsistent Style | Conflicting style references, weak style signals | ‚Ä¢ Reduce number of style references<br>‚Ä¢ Increase weight of primary style<br>‚Ä¢ Use dedicated LoRAs or embeddings |
| Poor Composition | Lack of composition guidance, competing elements | ‚Ä¢ Add explicit composition terms: "rule of thirds, balanced composition"<br>‚Ä¢ Simplify scene elements<br>‚Ä¢ Add camera position guidance |

### Model-Specific Limitations

| Model | Known Limitations | Workarounds |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Midjourney | Text rendering | ‚Ä¢ Use simple text phrases<br>‚Ä¢ Request "clear legible text"<br>‚Ä¢ Consider post-processing |
| DALL-E 3 | Multiple subjects with specific arrangements | ‚Ä¢ Break complex scenes into multiple generations<br>‚Ä¢ Focus on one main subject with detailed context |
| Stable Diffusion | Hands and limbs | ‚Ä¢ Use "perfect hands" in positive prompt<br>‚Ä¢ Include detailed hand descriptions in negative prompt<br>‚Ä¢ Use dedicated hand LoRAs |
